# android-challenge
As arranged, please find your coding challenge by opening this link:

A "JOB" is a task to be executed by an employee on a given date and location. There is a list of jobs that can be accessed via http://private-14c693-rentapanda.apiary-mock.com/jobs.
Create an Android application listing all the jobs. A Job details screen should be presented when taping in one of the listed jobs.

##Observations:

-Make use of Kotlin, Android Architecture Components (LiveData, ViewModel, Room), Coroutines and MVVM architecture.
-Consider that the application may be accessed without Internet connection (cached data would be very welcome).
